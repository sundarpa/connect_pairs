Let's create a program for finding the pattern among strings called vectors using python
Here's the rule when we do this, at the end of every request please summarise what is been done so far.
Assume the input vector contains strings which are separated by underscore which has up to 6 to 7 words.
Each word contains length of up to 3 to 5 characters.
The 4th and 5th word has some patterns that get's repeated after every 20 vectors.
Give me those examples.

Assume a string that contains 7 words separated by _ next split those words using _ and assign the rows as columns for the data frame.
Name the columns as column 123 up to seven . 
If column three contains the word INI then filter and get only that value and assign it to a temporary  table.

Assume there is another table that contains two columns called column A and column B .
Now join these two tables by combining column a = column 4 column B = column 5.
