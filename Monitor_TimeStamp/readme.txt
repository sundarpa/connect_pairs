Timestamp compare and update
I have 4 level of child tables connected each other using fk. each table has a column called updated timestamp. If the inner most gets updated then update the outer table respectively. Join the three tables. create a sample tables. Create a sql query. call this in python. compare the current time with the last run timestamp in the outmost table. Search recently updated row from the innermost table to outermost. Use Joins to connect inner to outer tables. Also take the recent date from outer table as a reference and search in each inner table if the timestamp in inner table is recent or not.
Use csv tables as an option for the data table source
let both csv and mysql data source be there, using a switch make the selection
once the data is read from mysql or csv store them in to a df, then later process the df using one code. 

Testcase:
create these csv using python and do testcase
combine csv creation and testcase
