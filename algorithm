Let's create a program for finding the pattern among strings called vectors using python
Here's the rule when we do this, at the end of every request please summarise what is been done so far.
Assume the input vector contains strings which are separated by underscore which has up to 6 to 7 words.
Each word contains length of up to 3 to 5 characters.
The 4th and 5th word has some patterns that get's repeated after every 20 vectors.
Give me those examples.
